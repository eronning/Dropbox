RUNNING THE PROGRAM:

Running the server (which is on the VM -- run from the root of the VM):

./application/server/server dropbox-eronning-wh7.foouniversity.com:8080

Connecting to the server with the client (which is not on the VM -- run from the base directory of the handin):

./application/client/client dropbox-eronning-wh7.foouniversity.com:8080

HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS:

When connecting with the client, a user is capable of either signing up or logging in. The
user can choose one of these options to be validated by the server and connect to an
account. Once the user is connected to an account they are capable of maneuvering their
dropbox directory. The user is capable of seeing their files and directories. They are able 
to upload files to a location on their filesystem. They are also able to download files from
their filesystem.
